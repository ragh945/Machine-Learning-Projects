## 📌 What is Machine Learning?

**Machine Learning** is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables systems to learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.

It includes:
- Supervised Learning (Classification, Regression)
- Unsupervised Learning (Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction)
- Reinforcement Learning (Learning through rewards)
- Feature Engineering, Model Evaluation, and Optimization

## 🐍 Why Python for Machine Learning?

Python is the go-to language for ML due to:
- Extensive libraries and frameworks (like `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `xgboost`, etc.)
- Easy integration with data analysis and visualization tools
- Broad community and support for ML experimentation
